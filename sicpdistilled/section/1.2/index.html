<h1>Procedures and the Processes They Generate</h1>

<p>We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used
primitive arithmetic operations, we have combined these operations,
and we have abstracted these composite operations by defining them as
compound procedures. But that is not enough to enable us to say that
we know how to program. Our situation is analogous to that of someone
who has learned the rules for how the pieces move in chess but knows
nothing of typical openings, tactics, or strategy. Like the novice
chess player, we don’t yet know the common patterns of usage in the
do- main. We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making (which
procedures are worth defining). We lack the experience to predict the
consequences of making a move (executing a procedure).</p>

<p>The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under con-
sideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it is
in any synthetic, creative activity. In becoming an expert
photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and
know how dark each region will appear on a print for each possible
choice of exposure and development conditions. Only then can one
reason backward, plan- ning framing, lighting, exposure, and
development to obtain the desired effects. So it is with programming,
where we are planning the course of action to be taken by a process
and where we control the process by means of a program. To become
experts, we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various
types of procedures. Only after we have developed such a skill can we
learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired
behavior.</p>

<p>A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational
process. It specifies how each stage of the process is built upon the
previ- ous stage. We would like to be able to make statements about
the overall, or global , behavior of a process whose local evolution
has been specified by a procedure. This is very difficult to do in
general, but we can at least try to describe some typical patterns of
process evolution.  In this section we will examine some common
“shapes” for pro- cesses generated by simple procedures. We will also
investigate the rates at which these processes consume the important
computational resources of time and space. The procedures we will
consider are very simple. Their role is like that played by test
patterns in photography: as oversimplified prototypical patterns,
rather than practical examples in their own right.</p>
